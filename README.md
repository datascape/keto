[Ditch the cheat days when on Keto](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/03/190327112657.htm) - Eating sugars while on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet can lead to damaged blood vessels. Researchers were surprised to find that just one 75-gram dose of glucose, the equivalent of a large bottle of soda or a plate of fries, can cause immediate blood vessel damage.  


## Yummy foods with high fat, low carbs and minimal sugars

Eggs and avocados. Dark berries: raspberries, blackberries, cherries, plums, strawberries.

Chicken with the skin.  Bacon, lamb, steak.  

Seafood (wild salmon, tuna and shrimp).  

Cheese, plain Greek yogurt, and cottage cheese.  

Olives and olive oil.  

“Above ground” vegetables – broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, artichokes.

Leafy greens – spinach, kale, etc.  Collard Greens! Mushrooms — shiitake, king oyster, lion’s mane, etc.

High fat “dairy” – unsweetened coconut-based yogurt, coconut cream, vegan cheeses, etc.

Nuts and seeds – pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.

Fermented foods — Natto, sauerkraut, kimchi.  

Sea vegetables — dulse, bladderwrack, kelp, etc.

Vegan “meats” — tempeh, seitan, and other high-protein, low-carb vegan “meats.”

Other fats – coconut oil, olive oil, MCT oil, avocado oil, etc.

Morning coffee with coconut oil or MCT Oil (start slow with a teaspoon) and grass-fed butter, you'll need a blender.
